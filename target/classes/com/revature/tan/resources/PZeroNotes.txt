# Notes for P0

A half-stack banking app.

This is the "com.revature.tan.resources" package. The "resources" package would usually
contain frontend resources, like JS, HTML, and CSS files. Since this project is only
a console-based display, it will be empty. But I have added a package as good practice.

This is where I'll keep my notes too.
